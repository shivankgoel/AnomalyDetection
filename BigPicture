1.       Abstract

Citizens are often uninformed or misinformed of economic realities. Our goal is to present to them simplified economic data over time, especially about contentious aspects of the Indian economy, which will help them understand the impact of different economic policies and become more informed citizens. We aim to do this by leveraging big-data sources such as satellite imagery, social media, news articles, and economic data sources such as censuses and surveys, to build an economy monitor which will continuously augment itself with new data and present a longitudinal view of the state of the economy in simplified terms geared towards the lay person. Our work will utilize techniques from machine learning, econometrics, text analytics, visualization, etc, and will draw upon collaborations with economists and journalists.
2.       Introduction and objective

The state of an economy and how it is changing is poorly understood by most people. Electoral politics tends to be about making rhetorical claims on the nature of economic growth, and scientific analysis presented by economists and academics is often based on complicated statistics and principles which are hard for people to understand. Our goal in this project is to present simplified data about some key aspects of the economy, by drawing from multiple sources of economic data such as the national accounts and industry surveys, censuses and surveys, news media, satellite data, etc to make it easier for people to understand and monitor the trajectory of the economy. Some of the key aspects we will monitor are as follows:
-          Socio-economic growth over time, at the district or sub-district level, to help people visualize the fastest or slowest growing regions, explore relationships between growth and the presence or absence of industries or the extent of social welfare spend in the regions, and spot news articles which can potentially explain the observations or give a more qualitative flavour to the data.

-          Agricultural commodity prices, to understand price realizations by the farmers on the one hand, and detect anomalies in retail prices for the consumers on the other hand, along with explaining the reasons for price fluctuations and realizations through easy to understand qualitative references from news media.

-          Key economic indicators such as per capita wealth, wage rates, income distribution, rural-urban population distribution, social welfare spend, etc, presented at a disaggregated level with a view to help people understand the diversity in socio-economic conditions of the population mix in the country, and how the economy is changing.

-          Corporate and political interlocks at the national level, to visualize at what layers are interlocks transforming, and juxtapose them against policy changes and economic indicators to provide added contextual information to interpret changes in the political economy.

The reason why we have chosen these aspects is to uncover details about themes where severe contention prevails in public understanding in the Indian context. For example, does industrialization lead to socio-economic development of the region, are farmers able to earn enough from their agricultural lands, how have the gains from economic growth been distributed across the population, how well are public services able to address socio-developmental problems in different regions, are budget allocation and economic policies tilting towards corporate welfare at the cost of social welfare…? These are some questions on which various stakeholders regularly argue but ordinary citizens rarely understand the facts and are susceptible to rhetoric which is increasingly easier to propagate through social media or biased mass media channels.
Given this context, our research goal is to be able to draw data from various sources, and present a simplified view of the economy to people. This will lead to a more informed citizenry, and our data collation output and analysis tools will also help academics and journalists to analyse the data more easily and present accurate stories to the people.
3.       Methodology and outputs

Each of the key aspects of the economy we want to monitor, has specific challenges to be solved:
-          Potential of big data to reveal socio-economic trends at fine geographical scales: National censuses at the district and sub-district level in India happen only once in ten years. National surveys at the state level are slightly more frequent and happen once in five years. However, in today’s highly connected and well instrumented age, big-data sources such as satellite imagery, social media, and mass media reports, churn out large amounts of data at a high frequency, and have already been shown to be effective to predict national level indicators such as GDP [1] or sub-regional indicators such as asset ownership [2]. These studies have not been performed in the Indian context however, and have not been applied to comprehensively compare different regions with each other to understand the varying growth patterns of these regions. Our first goal is to build a profile at different cross-sections of time for each district by gleaning information from censuses, news articles, and other economic data sources. Our second goal is to then use these features to explain growth patterns using longitudinal indexes of development built from satellite data and various economic data sources. Research challenges arise in building accurate indicators from satellite data which are well correlated with development indexes [3], and to learn relevant district level profile features from news articles which refer to the districts [4].

-          Anomaly detection in agricultural production and commodity prices: In the Indian agricultural space, mal-practices are rampant like the hoarding of commodities to create supply shortages which leads to high prices for consumers, or the exploitation of smallholder farmers by traders and middlemen which leads to low price realizations for producers. Although annual production and yield statistics, and daily prices of agricultural commodities at the wholesale and retail levels, are easily available from across the country, the government’s actions to control prices is often reactive and transpires only after significant collective action or politicisation of the issues. This is because while economists have tried to understand commodity price fluctuations and attribute them to speculation in the financial markets, oil prices, rainfall, etc [5, 6] an overarching ready-to-use platform is not available for people or policy makers to be able to easily ascertain anomalous behavior at different spatiotemporal scales. To build such a platform, we have collated the last ten years of commodity arrivals and wholesale price data from across 1500+ agricultural markets in India, retail price data from across 100+ regional centres, regional monthly rainfall data, and news articles related to agricultural events. We are now learning from the behavior observed in time series of prices and arrivals about the events mentioned in news articles, and we will use this model to detect anomalies in the current date. Research challenges arise in learning time series models based on events identified in news articles, but where the news articles themselves may be delayed or inaccurate or absent, and hence require domain knowledge to detect or correct the errors in training data.

-          Monitoring of corporate-political interlocks at the national level: Much has been written about elite capture to influence governance policies [7], and in the light of extreme income inequality this topic is even more relevant today than ever [8]. Corporate-political interlocks manifest themselves in many ways, including crony capitalism of the basest form like being able to raise debt from public banks despite growing non-performing assets [9] or illicit cash transfers for election funding [10], the ability to influence policy on sensitive areas like labour reforms and environmental clearances and taxation [11], or even just a greater alignment of economic and political views at the cost of other alternative viewpoints. These interlocks are hard to observe because of poor data availability of the who’s who in business and politics, but over the last two years we have painstakingly accumulated from multiple structured and unstructured data on the web, a large social network of central and state level politicians, their family members, bureaucrats, appointments in different departments and ministries, public companies and ownership networks, and the board of directors and large shareholders in the companies. Our goal now is to analyse this graph at different cross-sections to identify changes in the corporate-political interlocks over time, the layers where these interlocks are getting stronger or weaker, build applications that make it easier for journalists and researchers to find high-ranking paths linking different entities, and to find related news articles that may provide more information about these interlocks. To do this, a key research challenge for us is entity resolution in data acquired from multiple different sources, for which we are building an algorithm that gradually builds up more and more contextual information about different entities to improve the accuracy of resolution.

-          Visualization of data about the economy: Economic data such as the national accounts are released as reports on the websites of various government statistics departments, very few states have their data available online in an organized format, and open-data initiatives such as data.gov.in have unfortunately degenerated into just an assorted collection of Excel sheets with little consistently and completeness. Economists painstakingly acquire this data and analyse it to write insightful reports which are presented in the form of research papers or news articles. However, these tend to be one-time studies and hardly any repetition of the same analysis year on year is seen. Consequently, while it is similar topics that are under debate each year, the analysis is available only piece-wise. To address this problem, we have attempted to build a data model for storing regularly released economic data in a standard format, and on which we will then layer different analysis templates to be able to present easy to understand visualizations that get updated year on year as more data is fed into the database. We are building semi-automated data collection routines that can fetch new data as and when it becomes available, and are collaborating with economists to advice on appropriate analysis templates to build. This data and analysis can also be used to enrich the output from the earlier described economic aspects being monitored by us.

Being able to present easily accessible data about the economy, especially on contentious topics, and making it easier for researchers and journalists to analyse the data and write about it, will lead to more informed debate and more aware citizens. Our research group is building different components of the system using platforms like Google Earth Engine for satellite data analysis, neo4j for storage of social network graphs, MongoDB and Elasticsearch for indexing and retrieval of news articles, OpenCalais for entity recognition, various Twitter APIs to access social media data, etc. We are collaborating with economics faculty in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, with machine learning and data analytics faculty in the Department of Computer Science, and with industry collaborators such as How India Lives and Gram Vaani for access to more data sources.
The alternate to our project is highly accurate, complete, and credible data-based journalism. To answer the kind of questions listed above, journalists have to acquire, clean, and sift through large amounts of data. This is also often done in a case-study like approach of uncovering patterns which will result in a news story, but which may not get revisited in a process oriented manner, consequently leading to piece-wise event-based narratives. We are instead building a longitudinal monitor, ie. it will monitor a large set of economic patterns over time by acquiring and cleaning data from many sources, build rules to check and cross-check the data, maintain the data in appropriate formats, and run regressions and pattern detection algorithms, to ultimately paint an accurate picture of the state of the economy for the people to understand and react.
4.       Broader research canvas

For over the last decade, our research group has been active in the space of Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICTD). We have designed, deployed, and scaled technologies in challenging rural environments, for people with low literacy and often first time users of automated information technologies. Our work has resulted in the spinoff of a social enterprise, Gram Vaani, which has emerged as a global leader in building technology-aided community media networks for social development. We have also actively engaged in policy advocacy in the adoption of appropriate technologies with the Government of India departments of Information and Broadcasting, Health, Rural Development, Panchayati Raj, and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, and have also influenced the use of information and communication technology with over a hundred social sector organizations and philanthropic foundations.
This project dovetails into the larger canvas of work done by us in the ICTD space. Our prior work in ICTD focused on putting technology in the hands of low-income and marginalized community groups, and empowering them to express themselves in a bottom-up manner. This project takes a top-down approach by using data to understand how economic processes work and affect the lives of people on the ground. Our vision is to eventually bridge these top-down and bottom-up information networks to be able to build an accurate macro-to-micro view, for example, that a rural unemployment rate of 7.15% actually translates to stories like that of Raju Kumar from the Simaria block of Chatra district in Jharkhand, “I migrated to Mumbai with my elder brother to earn a livelihood, but the only work I found paid me one hundred rupees per day as labour charges. I was very unhappy about the fact that even after being literate I was having to live the life of a daily wage earner. I also found it very difficult to get accustomed to the fast lifestyle of Mumbai and I was always looked down upon by the locals who considered migrants as outsiders even in the same country.”
Our group is motivated by building real systems that can lead to change, and our goal with this project will be the same, to actually build the Giant Economy Monitor for India and engage with citizens to use the platform.
5.       Past work funded by Google

Google India funded a small project of USD 10,000 during the period of 2015-2016 under the same PI, on the use of mobile based technology to facilitate the involvement of civil society volunteers in assisting rural and marginalized people in the redressal of their grievances related to the delivery of social welfare schemes. The project was implemented in 5 districts in rural Jharkhand, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh in India, and led to highly rated publications and the adoption of the pilot by UNDP for scale-up implementation in partnership with the National Informatics Centre (NIC) of the Government of India. The PhD student who led this work is now actively engaged with UNDP and NIC to validate the model at a larger scale, and advocate for potential adoption as a standard strategy to build citizen engagement in the implementation of social welfare schemes.
